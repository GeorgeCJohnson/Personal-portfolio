# Personal-Portfolio

## Description:

When you visit this site you will be greeted by an image of me with my son and my name.  There is a hello message and some navigation links in the nav bar at the top.  As you scroll down the page you will see an about me section followed by my projects.  Lastly I added the Google embedded map for fun which is followed by a footer containing links to my social media sites.

## How it works:

Site navigation can be achieved either by nav bar or scrolling.  The page is reactive based on the size of the screen the user has selected.  The nav bar goes dark on scroll so that the links are easier to read.  When a user selects the link associated with one of the portfolio projects, they are taken to the project page as hosted by GitHub.  The google embedded map also has the standard contact form which if filled out and submitted sends an email to my personal address.  The social media link will take the user to my social media account.
